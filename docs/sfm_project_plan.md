# Structure From Motion Project Plan

This document describes a plan for using stucture from motion as a tool for archeological research.
Most of these are a result of our initial work on a sfm pipeline.

### Requirements

- The pipeline should be completely automatic, and not require any user input other than the images themselves
- The time required to process an image set should be as short as possible. 10 minutes would be perfect, up to a few hours is fine, longer than a day is unnacceptable.
- The pipeline should not require any local software installation.
- Data acquisition should be as streamlined as possible, and not require too many pre-processing steps.

### Assumptions

- Images are taking with a `standard` prosumer DSLR camera.
- Data gathering expeditions are in general at least several days.
- A decent Internet connection is available during the expedition (though not neccesairily in the field)
